			<h2>Excellence in Dentistry</h2>
			<p>We use all the latest digital technology and materials in private treatment options where each treatment plan is bespoke and carefully structured to offer the very best of  21st Century Dentistry with &#39;time to care&#39;. Please discuss option this with your dental surgeon.</p>
			<p>For more general care there are three choices: </p>
			
			<h3>Independent Dentistry</h3>
			<p>This is then name we give to our services for patients who want an improved range of treatment with the comfort and flexibility that independent contract offers. We are of the opinion that our independent dentistry offers the best &#39;value for money&#39; dental service in the High Wycombe area.</p>
			<p><strong>Please download our independent fees guide <a href="includes/independent-fees.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong></p>
	
			<!--
			<h3>Practice Plan</h3>
			<p>This is a membership scheme which has been devised by the practice. It provides discount for private treatments and is some instance cheaper than the banded treatments on the NHS. It has been created to be fair for the patient and the practitioner. It is particularly good scheme for patients needing extensive or cosmetic treatments as it will reduce the treatment cost significantly.</p>
			-->
			
			<h3>Denplan</h3>
			<p>With Denplan you normally pay a monthly fee and have all your treatment covered. The only exception to this is where any lab work is necessary. The cost of the laboratory work is paid by the patient. To become a Denplan patient, we normally carry out an assessment to inform you of the fee scale you will join. The normal cost of this is &pound;38. If you wish to join the scheme please contact our reception team and we will organise the rest.</p>	
			<p><strong>For more information please <a href="http://www.denplan.co.uk/patients/through-my-dentist" target="_blank">visit www.denplan.co.uk</a>.</strong></p>
		
			<h3>Dental Care Plan</h3>
			<p>This is an in-house capitation scheme that offers similar benefits to Denplan.
			For some patients this may be more cost effective. The assessment fee for this is &pound;38.00 and you will then be advised regarding the best way forwards.</p>
