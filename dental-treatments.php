			<h2>Routine Dentistry</h2>
			
			<h3>Routine Check Ups</h3>
			<p>Routine check ups are important as they helps to maintain your oral health and confidence. We check your whole mouth, look at your gum health, and inspect each surface of your teeth. <strong>It also includes oral cancer screening check.</strong> We may take x rays that let us look inside your teeth and underneath the fillings and between your teeth, inspecting those hard to get at areas. Helping you maintain health and being able to spot potential problems before they evolve is best for you in the long term.</p>
		
			<h3>Scale and Polishes</h3>
			<p>Brushing alone is sometimes not enough in the war against plaque; the help of a scale and polish from your dentist or hygienist can make a lot of difference. It can also help to improve your smile and remove stains that collect over a period of months.</p>

			<h3>Fillings</h3>
			<p>Filling are used to restore a tooth back to function which may have ben lost through decay or damage. They can be metal where amalgam has been traditionally used for many years and are still widely and safely used in dentistry. Tooth coloured fillings help to maintain the natural look of the tooth and are secured to teeth by using a special bonding technique to provide a good strength.</p>

			<h2>Cosmetic and Restorative Dentistry</h2>
			
			<h3>Crowns, Veneers and Bridges</h3>
			<p>There are many techniques that will help to restore your teeth and your mouth back to health. Chewing can become easier and importantly the teeth can look like 'almost new'.</p>
			<p>We offer high quality techniques including veneers, crowns and bridges in order to achieve this.</p>
			<p>Modern techniques are increasingly using metal free materials that can help to give excellent life-like results.</p>

			<h3>Tooth Whitening</h3>
			<p>This is a common procedure in general dentistry. It is a simple and safe procedure to lighten an existing colour of your teeth. We use two methods at the Clinic; one is providing patient with a home bleaching kit (which is supervised) and the other one is Zoom Whitening, which is done in the dental chair instantly.</p>

			<h2>Advanced Dentistry</h2>
			
			<h3>Dentures</h3>
			<p>Missing teeth can produce many challenges. Appearance can be greatly affected and this impacts on confidence, security and eating.</p>
			<p>One way of replacing missing teeth is with dentures and they can be made according to individual demands and by using the best materials and artistry.</p>
			<p>Our top of the range implant-dentures can be hard to detect. With a small number of dental implants, dentures can be effectively secured in the mouth, greatly enhancing confidence.</p>

			<h2>Dental Implants</h2>
			<p>More commonly missing teeth are being replaced with dental implants. Otherwise know as 'screw-in teeth', they replace missing teeth using small titanium inserts into the jawbone, providing a foundation for crowns, bridges and dentures much like a natural tooth root would. Dental implants can be seen as your 'third set of teeth'. </p>			
			<p>All implant treatments are carried out at the clinic by Max Suleiman. He is also a Consultant Oral Surgeon at Guy's Hospital where he is involved with teaching implant surgery as well as ground breaking research in implant dentistry.</p>
