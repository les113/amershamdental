		 Amersham Hill Dental Clinic - Dental EmergenciesÂ Only</h2>
		<div class="covid19Msg">
			<p>As from the 8th June 2020 the Surgery will be open in a limited capacity. We are currently
			seeing Emergency patients for Assessments and Advice only. Ensuring the safety of our
			patients and staff is our priority and of upmost importance. We have been working hard over
			the last few weeks preparing for re-opening the practice, however due to lack of available
			PPE we will be operating in a limited capacity until we have a good reliable supply of these
			essential items. We would like to inform you of the changes we need to implement to reduce
			the risk to patients, their families and to our staff. Due to recent guidelines the appointment
			times will be extended and therefore we will be seeing fewer patients per day, so please be
			patient with us. Staff will also be wearing masks, face shields and a disposable gown or
			apron (PPE) depending on the procedure you are having.
