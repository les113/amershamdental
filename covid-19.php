		<div class="covid19Msg">
			<p>We are open and welcoming our patients to the Surgery.
			We have been busy ensuring all of our Dental Team have been retrained in new
			procedures and we have put in place measures to keep patients and staff safe.
			It will take time before services fully return to normal but patients who need
			Emergency Treatment will be prioritised.
			We are now seeing Patients for their routine Examinations and Hygiene
			appointments. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Due to the guidelines the appointment times will be extended and therefore we will
			be seeing fewer patients per day, so please be patient with us.
			Staff will also be wearing masks, face shields and a disposable gown or apron (PPE)
			depending on the procedure you are having.
